Push Go does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data from users. This extension operates solely as a client interface for the Pushbullet API.

## Data Usage

This extension:
- Communicates exclusively with Pushbullet API servers to send and receive pushes
- Displays content received from the Pushbullet API servers
- Transmits only the content you explicitly choose to send to the Pushbullet API

## Local Storage

The extension stores the following data locally in your browser:
- Your Pushbullet access token
- Device and chat information retrieved from the Pushbullet API
- Recent push history (up to 100 items)

This data remains on your device and is not transmitted to any servers other than the Pushbullet API.

## Third-Party Services

This extension integrates with the Pushbullet API service. All data handling by Pushbullet is governed by their privacy policy, which you can review at: https://www.pushbullet.com/privacy
